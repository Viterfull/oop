# Telephone switch

 
## Description
this program allows you to emulate the telephone network (land -> country -> operator -> subscriber),
in which, in addition to regular numbers, there are numbers that automatically forward messages to other numbers.
`main.cpp` describes in sufficient detail how to create countries, operators, subscribers, and send messages.

## Build and Run!
